# generator-botbuilder
> Yeoman generator for Microsoft Bot Framework

## Features

Scaffolds a bot using [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com), and provides a set of dialogs to jump start bot development.

### Dependencies

- [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) for managing environmental variables
- [restify](http://restify.com/) for hosting the API

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-botbuilder using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

Since we are developing the generator locally, it’s not yet available as a global npm module. A global module may be created and symlinked to a local one, using npm. 
In order to do that, we need to navigate to the generator-botbuilder folder and type:

```bash
npm link
```

That will install the project dependencies and symlink a global module to your local file. After npm is done, we need to type:

```bash
yo botbuilder
```

This will start a set of prompts that will guide the bot creation. The bot will be created inside generator-botbuilder and we can just run it using node.

### Next Steps

- Update `.env` with your keys as needed
- Add your logic
