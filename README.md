# Bot Builder SDK 

The Bot Builder SDK enables you to build bots that support different types of interactions with users. You can design conversations in your bot to be freeform. Your bot can also have more guided interactions where it provides the user choices or actions. The conversation can use simple text or more complex rich cards that contain text, images, and action buttons. You can add natural language interactions and questions and answers, which let your users interact with your bots in a natural way.

The Bot Builder includes a set of [command line tools](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-tools) to streamline end-to-end conversation centric development experience, and an [emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) for debugging your bot locally or in the cloud. 

## Get started with Bot Builder v4 (Preview) 

*Bot Builder SDK v4 is the latest SDK for building bot applications. It is in **Preview** state. Production bots should continue to be developed using the **v3 SDK** - [csharp](CSharp), [node](Node).*

It is easy to build your first Bot. You can create a bot with [Azure Bot Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart?view=azure-bot-service-4.0). Click [here](https://account.azure.com/signup) if you need a trial Azure subscription.

## Adding intelligence to your bot
Your bot can provide a great conversational experience without using any Azure Cognitive Services. You can increase your customers' delight with adding a more natural interaction using one or multiple Azure Cognitive Services.  The following are common services integrated to bots: 
- [LUIS](https://www.luis.ai)
- [QnA Maker](https://www.qnamaker.ai/)
- [Speech](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/directory/speech/)
- all [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/)
